# SUDO (android app)

_This is the repository of the android part of our submission._

**SUDO** is a bot which helps you primarily to book and schedule cabs.
The android application works as an interface where the user can choose to book a cab using voice or text input.
We will intimate the user via notifications when the booking has been confirmed
